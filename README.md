# LilHank Arduino Keyboard
What do you do with a six key tester from aliExpress? You turn it into the most extra board around! 

Powered by an Arduino pro-micro clone and 6 different keys-switches, variety is the name of the game.  The board itself simply outputs F7 - F12 and I use [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) on Mac, and  [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) on Windows to output the media keys.
